# KickTheCancerOutGame
Kick Cancer Out! is an educational 3D game developed using the Unity engine in collaboration with the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC). The game uniquely combines a penalty-shooting sports mechanic with an interactive quiz system to raise awareness about cancer and prevention in a fun and engaging way.
## ðŸŽ® Gameplay and Key Features
The gameâ€™s objective is to shoot the ball into the correct goal to answer health-related questions. The gameplay includes:

Quiz System: Players are presented with randomized health questions. Two answers appear on either side of the goal, and the player must shoot the ball at the correct one.

Shooting Mechanic: The player controls the ball's direction with the arrow keys. Pressing the spacebar triggers the kick.

Scoring and Lives: A correct answer earns a point, while a wrong answer or a missed shot costs a life.

Progressive Difficulty: The game features three levels, with questions becoming more challenging as you advance. In the third level, moving obstacles are added to the goal to increase the difficulty of aiming.

Sound Effects: The game includes crowd cheers, sound effects for goals, misses, and win/loss states to enhance the player experience.
##ðŸ›  Technologies and Tools
Game Engine: Unity.

Programming Language: C#, used to manage game logic, UI updates, and quiz validation.

Physics System: The Rigidbody and Colliders systems in Unity were used to simulate realistic ball movement and collisions.

Graphics and UI: The UI System (Canvas, Text, Buttons) was used for all in-game menus, displaying questions, and managing the score.

Assets:

3D Models: Player, field, ball, and obstacle models were imported from Sketchfab.

Animations: Player animations were sourced from Mixamo and controlled via the Animator Controller.

Sound Effects: All sound effects were downloaded from Freesound.org.

Prefabs: The ball and arrow were made into Prefabs for easy reusability and dynamic instantiation during gameplay.
